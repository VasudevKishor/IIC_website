          Genesis 2025 is a three-day event conducted by Institution’s
          Innovation Council, an initiative by the Ministry of Education to
          foster innovation and start-up culture in universities. This event
          serves as a celebration of ideas and innovation, giving students
          direct access to investors, mentors, and thought leaders. Participate
          in our flagship event, Exodus, a competition focused on pitching your
          best ideas and adapting to business scenarios. Expand your
          entrepreneurship knowledge by attending our workshops on
          Prototype/Process Development and Design, and Business Model Canvas.
          The ATAL Sarthi Project Showcase is also a part of Genesis’25, which
          will be a one-day exhibition designed to encourage young innovators
          to showcase their creative solutions in STEM, sustainability,
          entrepreneurship, and social impact.
